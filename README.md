# The Randomiser
I developed this simple app to access on my phone. It's intended for those moments when you need a die and can't seem to find any of the hundreds of dice you know are lurking in the back of a drawer somewhere.

## How to use the app
Enter a minimum and maximum value and then click the Roll button each time you want to roll.

## Dependencies
The app uses JQuery 2.2.4 for DOM manipulation. This is loaded via a CDN.
